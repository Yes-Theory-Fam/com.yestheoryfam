  "As our love for travelling and meeting new people brings us together, we wanted to create a platform that enables others to connect and find like-minded people, the same way we found each other. So we did it. One place for it all: upcoming meetups, stories of strangers-turned-friends, events that allow you to meet each other, photos of adventures, and so much more. We hope that through this platform, you’ll turn strangers into lifelong friends!";
