      Once you do that, you will be asked to join the Yes Theory Fam server (if

      Yes Bot, our very own bot, will message you on discord with the name of
      your partner and a set of questions. Your buddy and you will both get a
      message, and you‚Äôll have to make sure to message each other! You‚Äôll have
      two different sets of questions, and you‚Äôll each take turns asking a
      question from your list, and both answering, until there are no more
      questions left.

      We hope you enjoy and make a lifelong friend. Don‚Äôt forget to update us on
